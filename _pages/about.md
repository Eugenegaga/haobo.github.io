About Me
======
I am a PhD student focusing on semiconductor device physics, with experience in compact modeling, TCAD simulations, and first-principles calculations. Currently, I am exploring the use of AI techniques, including neural networks and generative models, to accelerate device modeling and simulation workflows.

Research Interests
======
**Quantum and First-Principles Device Modeling**  
- Quantum transport simulation via Wigner–Boltzmann and Signed-Particle Monte Carlo methods  
- Full-band carrier dynamics including electron–phonon and electron–electron scattering  
- ab initio computation of electronic and phononic properties (DFT, DFPT, GW, RPA) for transport modeling in 2D materials
- 
**AI for Semiconductor Design Automation**  
- Neural-network-based compact modeling and parameter extraction  
- AI-accelerated TCAD simulation and device/process structure generation





Projects
======
**Compact Modeling of Advanced RF SOI Devices** *(Completed)*  
Developed a surface-potential-based compact model for advanced SOI transistors.  
- First identified Lorentzian-type low-frequency excess noise behavior and its physical origin  
- Proposed a circuit-compatible compact model for RF noise simulation in SOI platforms  

**Modeling and Analysis of Ultra-Low-Power Heterojunction Devices** *(Ongoing)*  
Constructed compact models for zero subthreshold swing (0 SS) devices based on silicon–graphene and silicon–metal heterojunctions.  
- Explained memory effects induced by carrier thermalization in silicon–graphene junctions  
- Analyzed the switching behavior and retention of semi-floating gate architectures  
- Validated compact models via circuit-level simulations  

**Pathfinding for 2D van der Waals Heterojunction Flash Using FB-MC WBTE** *(Ongoing)*  
Established a full-band Monte Carlo simulation framework based on the Wigner–Boltzmann Transport Equation to evaluate 2D-HCI flash memory devices.  
- Investigating quantum tunneling, retention, and programming efficiency at van der Waals interfaces  

**AI-Accelerated TCAD Simulation via Foundation Models** *(Ongoing)*  
Developing a generative-AI-driven framework to replace conventional TCAD process simulations.  
- Aims to predict device structure evolution and final profiles using large language models  
- Targeting FinFET and 2D devices with complex fabrication flows
